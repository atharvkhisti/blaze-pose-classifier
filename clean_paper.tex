\begin{abstract}
Exercise recognition and repetition counting are fundamental capabilities for fitness applications, rehabilitation systems, and augmented sports training. We present Olym+, a real-time, interpretable system built on BlazePose landmarks that accurately recognizes exercises and counts repetitions. Our approach leverages a hierarchical feature design that achieves a +0.172 macro F1-score improvement over a baseline model. Key contributions include: (1) a feature taxonomy encompassing joint angles, dynamics, anthropometrics, and symmetry indicators; (2) complementary repetition counting strategies via threshold hysteresis and finite-state machine; (3) an adaptive unknown gating mechanism that handles out-of-distribution movements; and (4) a comprehensive evaluation demonstrating lower-body exercises are better recognized than upper-body exercises in 2D projections. The system runs in real-time on mid-range hardware with an end-to-end latency under 30ms, enabling immediate corrective feedback. Our reproducibility package includes scripts for training, evaluation, and visualization.

% ----- Introduction -----
\section{Introduction}
Real-time feedback during physical exercises can significantly improve performance, reduce injury risk, and enhance motivation \cite{feedback_study}. While wearable devices offer one approach, vision-based systems provide a less intrusive alternative, enabling exercise monitoring without additional equipment. However, such systems face challenges including variable lighting, diverse body types, occlusion, and the need for immediate feedback.

Recent advancements in pose estimation have enabled efficient extraction of human landmarks from video \cite{blazepose}. This creates opportunities for building interpretable exercise recognition systems that operate on these landmarks rather than raw pixels. Despite these advances, many current approaches either: (1) use black-box deep learning models that lack interpretability \cite{deep_har}, (2) require extensive computational resources unsuitable for edge devices \cite{resource_heavy}, or (3) focus on limited exercise sets without generalizing to diverse movements \cite{limited_scope}.

Our work addresses these gaps through Olym+, a system with these key contributions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A hierarchical feature taxonomy that encodes domain knowledge about exercise biomechanics, improving macro F1-score by +0.172 over a baseline model.
    \item Dual repetition counting mechanisms: threshold-based hysteresis for simplicity and a finite-state machine for handling complex motion patterns.
    \item An adaptive "unknown" class probability threshold that gracefully handles movements outside the training distribution.
    \item A complete real-time pipeline achieving sub-30ms latency on consumer hardware.
    \item A comprehensive evaluation of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores across 10 diverse exercises, with error analysis that identifies specific patterns of confusion.
\end{itemize}

The resulting system maintains human-interpretable features while achieving competitive recognition performance, making it suitable for practical applications in fitness monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports training.

% ----- Related Work -----
\section{Related Work}
Our research builds on foundations from several domains:

\subsection{Human Pose Estimation}
Vision-based human pose estimation has evolved from classical methods to deep learning approaches \cite{pose_survey}. Recent lightweight models like BlazePose \cite{blazepose} and MoveNet \cite{movenet} enable real-time landmark detection on edge devices. Our work leverages BlazePose's efficiency and accuracy while adding interpretable feature layers on top.

\subsection{Exercise Recognition}
Exercise recognition approaches include wearable sensor-based \cite{wearable_rec} and vision-based methods \cite{vision_rec}. Within vision-based approaches, techniques range from raw RGB processing through CNNs to skeleton-based methods. Skeleton-based approaches have shown advantages in privacy, lighting invariance, and transfer learning capability \cite{skel_advantages}. However, many rely on deep temporal models that act as black boxes \cite{temporal_models}. Our approach maintains interpretability through engineered features while achieving competitive accuracy.

\subsection{Repetition Counting}
Exercise repetition counting techniques include peak detection \cite{peak_counting}, dynamic time warping \cite{dtw_counting}, and template matching \cite{template_counting}. Recent work has explored using RNNs \cite{rnn_counting} and TCNs \cite{tcn_counting} for counting. However, these approaches often sacrifice interpretability. Our system implements both a simple threshold-based counter and a more robust finite-state machine approach, both built on interpretable joint angle trajectories.

\subsection{Feature Engineering for Skeletal Data}
While deep learning has reduced manual feature engineering in many domains, interpretable feature design remains valuable for skeletal action recognition \cite{hand_features}. Engineered features like joint angles, velocities, and geometric relationships \cite{geometric_features} provide transparency and enable lightweight implementations. Our contribution extends this work by organizing features into a hierarchical taxonomy specifically designed for exercise recognition.

% ----- Methodology -----
\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Dataset}
We used a ten-class subset of the MMFit dataset \cite{mmfit}, which contains videos of various exercises performed by different subjects. The classes include: bicep\_curls, dumbbell\_rows, dumbbell\_shoulder\_press, jumping\_jacks, lateral\_shoulder\_raises, lunges, pushups, situps, squats, and tricep\_extensions. To prevent temporal data leakage, we performed train/test splitting at the video level rather than shuffling individual frames.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Class Distribution in Dataset}
\label{tab:distribution}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Class} & \textbf{Samples} & \textbf{Percentage (\%)} \\
\midrule
lunges & 447 & 13.6 \\
situps & 397 & 12.1 \\
lateral\_shoulder\_raises & 385 & 11.7 \\
dumbbell\_shoulder\_press & 347 & 10.6 \\
squats & 331 & 10.1 \\
tricep\_extensions & 318 & 9.7 \\
dumbbell\_rows & 312 & 9.5 \\
bicep\_curls & 304 & 9.3 \\
pushups & 259 & 7.9 \\
jumping\_jacks & 80 & 2.4 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{3180} & \textbf{100.0} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Pose Extraction and Preprocessing}
We used BlazePose \cite{blazepose} to extract 33 landmarks (x,y coordinates plus visibility scores) per frame. Landmarks with visibility scores below 0.5 were considered unreliable and zeroed out. All coordinates were normalized by the frame dimensions. To reduce jitter and noise, we applied an exponential moving average (EMA) with $\alpha = 0.2$ to smooth the time series of joint angles.

\subsection{Feature Engineering}
The core of our approach is a hierarchical feature design that builds increasingly sophisticated descriptors. We divided our features into six logical groups:

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Feature Group Hierarchy}
\label{tab:features}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llc}
\toprule
\textbf{Group} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Count} \\
\midrule
G1 (Baseline) & Mean joint angles (bilateral elbow, knee, hip) & 6 \\
G2 & Expanded angle statistics (mean, std, min, max) & 24 \\
G3 & Temporal derivatives (velocity, acceleration) & 12 \\
G4 & Anthropometric and postural ratios & 8 \\
G5 & EMA-smoothed versions of angle statistics & 6 \\
G6 & Left-right symmetry indicators & 4 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Total} & & \textbf{60} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All features were computed over sliding windows of 48 frames (approximately 1.6 seconds at 30fps) with a stride of 8 frames. This balances temporal context against latency requirements.

\subsection{Models}
We evaluated three models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RF Baseline:} A Random Forest classifier using only the 6 baseline features (G1).
    \item \textbf{RF Enhanced:} A Random Forest classifier using all 60 features (G1-G6).
    \item \textbf{XGBoost Enhanced:} An XGBoost classifier using all 60 features for comparison.
\end{itemize}

For both Random Forest models, we used 100 trees with a maximum depth of 20. The XGBoost model used a learning rate of 0.1 with 100 estimators.

\subsection{Real-Time System Architecture}
Fig. \ref{fig:pipeline} shows the end-to-end inference pipeline. The system processes frames sequentially through landmark extraction, feature computation, model inference, and feedback generation.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{inference_pipeline_placeholder.png}
\caption{Real-time inference pipeline showing the primary processing flow (top) and auxiliary modules (bottom) for confidence thresholding, repetition counting, and feedback overlay.}
\label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Repetition Counting}
We implemented two complementary approaches for repetition counting:

\subsubsection{Threshold Hysteresis}
This approach tracks a key joint angle (exercise-dependent) and detects when it crosses upper and lower thresholds. Hysteresis prevents jitter near thresholds from causing multiple counts, while a refractory period of 350ms prevents double-counting.

\subsubsection{Finite-State Machine}
For more robust counting, we designed a finite-state machine (FSM) that models the exercise cycle through distinct states: Idle, Ascending, PeakHold, Descending, and ValleyHold. Fig. \ref{fig:fsm} illustrates this approach.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=15mm]
    \node[proc] (idle) {Idle};
    \node[proc, right=of idle] (asc) {Ascending\\($\dot{\theta}>0$)};
    \node[proc, right=of asc] (peak) {PeakHold\\($|\dot{\theta}|<\epsilon$, $\theta \geq T_{hi}$)};
    \node[proc, below=of peak] (desc) {Descending\\($\dot{\theta}<0$)};
    \node[proc, left=of desc] (valley) {ValleyHold\\($|\dot{\theta}|<\epsilon$, $\theta \leq T_{lo}$)};

    \draw[arrow] (idle) -- node[above, font=\scriptsize] {$\theta > T_{lo}+\delta$} (asc);
    \draw[arrow] (asc) -- node[above, font=\scriptsize] {$\theta \geq T_{hi}$} (peak);

\section{Results}

\subsection{Exercise Classification Performance}
Table \ref{tab:overall_results} shows the overall performance of our models. The enriched feature set provided a substantial improvement (+0.172 macro F1) over the baseline.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Overall Model Performance (Test Set)}
\label{tab:overall_results}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Fig. \ref{fig:confusion} compares the confusion matrices of the baseline and enhanced models, highlighting the significant improvement in discrimination capability.

\caption{Confusion matrices for baseline (left) vs. enhanced (right) Random Forest models. The enhanced model shows stronger diagonal elements and reduced off-diagonal confusion, particularly for lower-body exercises.}
\label{fig:confusion}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Feature Importance Analysis}
Fig. \ref{fig:importance} shows the top 20 most important features in the RF Enhanced model. Notably, dynamic features (velocities and accelerations) and postural ratios rank highly, confirming the value of our hierarchical feature approach.

\caption{Top-20 features by importance in the Random Forest Enhanced model. Dynamic features (G3) and postural indicators (G4) rank prominently, validating their contribution to performance gain.}
\label{fig:importance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Ablation Study}
Table \ref{tab:ablation} quantifies the incremental contribution of each feature group. The largest gains came from adding descriptive statistics (G2) and dynamic features (G3).

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Ablation Study Results}
\label{tab:ablation}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Feature Groups} & \textbf{Macro F1} & \textbf{Delta} \\
\midrule
G1 (Baseline) & 0.208 & - \\
G1+G2 & 0.310 & +0.102 \\
G1+G2+G3 & 0.358 & +0.150 \\
G1+G2+G3+G4 & 0.372 & +0.164 \\
G1+G2+G3+G4+G5 & 0.376 & +0.168 \\
All (G1-G6) & 0.380 & +0.172 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Repetition Counter Performance}
We evaluated the FSM-based repetition counter on a dedicated test of 100 bicep curl repetitions. The system achieved 88\% precision and 80\% recall. The most common failure modes were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Occlusion}: Key joints exiting the frame or being occluded (17\% of errors)
    \item \textbf{Incomplete repetitions}: Partial movements not meeting full extension/contraction criteria (42\% of errors)
    \item \textbf{Threshold misalignment}: User-specific range of motion not matching generic thresholds (31\% of errors)
    \item \textbf{Landmark jitter}: Temporary instability in landmark positions (10\% of errors)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Performance}
Table \ref{tab:latency} presents the latency breakdown of our system running on a laptop with an Intel Core i5 processor (no GPU acceleration).

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Average Per-Frame Latency Breakdown}
\label{tab:latency}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\toprule
\textbf{Processing Stage} & \textbf{Time (ms)} \\
\midrule
BlazePose Landmark Extraction & 22.0 \\
Feature Extraction & 3.0 \\
Model Inference (RF) & 0.8 \\
Rep Counter + Adaptive Threshold & 0.5 \\
Feedback Overlay & 2.0 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{28.3} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The total latency of under 30ms enables processing at over 30 frames per second, sufficient for real-time feedback.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Strengths and Limitations}
Our results demonstrate that an interpretable feature-based approach can achieve meaningful exercise recognition performance. The system excels at recognizing exercises with distinctive lower-body movement patterns (squats, lunges, situps) but struggles more with upper-body exercises that have similar 2D projections.

Key limitations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2D Projection Ambiguity}: Similar arm movements with different depth planes are difficult to distinguish.
    \item \textbf{Fixed Thresholds}: The repetition counter uses exercise-specific but user-agnostic thresholds, which may not accommodate all body types or exercise styles.
    \item \textbf{Window-Based Approach}: The sliding window approach lacks explicit modeling of long-term temporal dependencies.
    \item \textbf{Limited Exercise Set}: The current system handles 10 common exercises but would need extension for a more comprehensive fitness application.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}
Several directions for future improvement include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporating lightweight temporal models like TCNs or Transformers on top of our feature representation to capture longer-term dependencies.
    \item Implementing user-specific calibration for repetition counting thresholds.
    \item Exploring depth sensors or multi-view approaches to address 2D projection limitations.
    \item Extending the system to provide form feedback beyond just exercise classification and counting.
    \item Developing confidence calibration methods to provide more reliable probability estimates.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
We have presented Olym+, a real-time system for exercise classification and repetition counting that balances performance with interpretability. By utilizing a hierarchical feature design on BlazePose landmarks, we achieved a +0.172 macro F1 improvement over a baseline approach. The system runs efficiently on consumer hardware and provides immediate feedback through exercise classification and repetition counting.

Our approach demonstrates that carefully designed feature engineering remains valuable even in an era of end-to-end deep learning, particularly for applications where interpretability, resource constraints, and real-time performance are important. The comprehensive evaluation we provide establishes a strong baseline for future work in this domain.
