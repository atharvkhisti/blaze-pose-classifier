\begin{abstract}
We present a light-weight real-time exercise classifier and repetition counter built on BlazePose 2D skeletal landmarks. Our system extracts biomechanically relevant features from 33 pose landmarks and employs a hierarchical feature design that combines static joint angles, dynamic features, posture metrics, and temporal patterns. Using Random Forest and XGBoost models, the classifier achieves high accuracy while maintaining interpretability. The system includes two complementary repetition counting strategies: threshold-based hysteresis and a finite state machine approach. The implementation supports real-time classification from webcam input with visual feedback, making it suitable for home fitness applications, physical therapy, and athletic training. Performance analysis reveals strong recognition for exercises with distinct lower-body movements while identifying challenges in similar upper-body motions.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The popularity of home fitness applications has grown significantly in recent years, accelerated by global events that limited access to traditional gyms and fitness centers. Computer vision-based exercise monitoring systems offer an accessible alternative to wearable sensors for tracking physical activity, providing real-time feedback without requiring additional hardware beyond a camera. Such systems can help users maintain proper form, track their progress, and stay motivated.

Recent advances in pose estimation technology, particularly Google's BlazePose model, have made it possible to accurately detect human pose landmarks in real-time on consumer devices. BlazePose provides 33 body landmarks with high accuracy, enabling detailed analysis of body movements and positions. However, translating these raw landmarks into meaningful exercise classifications and repetition counts presents several challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Exercise movements vary significantly between individuals in terms of speed, range of motion, and form.
    \item Environmental factors such as lighting, camera angle, and occlusion can affect pose estimation quality.
    \item Distinguishing between similar exercises requires sophisticated feature engineering.
    \item Counting repetitions accurately requires tracking the exercise state through different phases.
\end{itemize}

In this paper, we present a comprehensive system that addresses these challenges through careful feature engineering, classifier design, and a state machine approach to repetition counting. Our system processes video input through BlazePose, extracts biomechanically relevant features, classifies the exercise being performed, and counts repetitions in real-time.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Dataset}
For our system, we created a custom dataset of five common exercises: squats, pushups, situps, jumping jacks, and lunges. The dataset was collected from multiple participants with diverse body types and exercise styles to ensure robustness. Each exercise class includes multiple repetitions captured from different angles and with varying speeds.

The raw video data was processed to extract BlazePose landmarks (33 joints with x, y coordinates and visibility scores). Low-confidence landmarks (visibility < 0.5) were filtered out to reduce noise. The dataset was split into training (80\%) and testing (20\%) sets, with the split performed at the video level to prevent temporal leakage between sets.

Data augmentation techniques such as small affine transformations and temporal stretching/compression were explored but not included in the final implementation as they showed minimal impact on overall performance.

\subsection{Pose Acquisition and Preprocessing}
We use Google's BlazePose model implemented through the MediaPipe framework to extract 33 body landmarks from each video frame. Each landmark consists of x and y coordinates (normalized to the image dimensions) and a confidence score. The system processes input at 30 FPS, providing sufficient temporal resolution for exercise analysis.

Our preprocessing pipeline includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Landmark Filtering:} Low-confidence landmarks (visibility < 0.5) are identified and excluded from feature calculations to reduce noise.
    \item \textbf{Temporal Smoothing:} An exponential moving average (EMA) is applied to the landmark streams to reduce jitter and stabilize measurements.
    \item \textbf{Coordinate Normalization:} Landmarks are normalized relative to body dimensions to ensure scale invariance across different users.
\end{itemize}

The preprocessing steps ensure robust landmark data for subsequent feature extraction while maintaining real-time performance.

\subsection{Feature Engineering}
Our feature engineering approach extracts biomechanically meaningful features from BlazePose landmarks. The features are organized into six categories:

\textbf{Static Joint Angles:} Key joint angles that characterize body posture, including knee flexion, elbow flexion, and torso inclination. These angles are invariant to scale, translation, and rotation.

\textbf{Dynamic Features:} First and second derivatives (velocity and acceleration) over a sliding window to capture motion dynamics. This helps distinguish between exercises with similar poses but different movement patterns.

\textbf{Posture Features:} Overall body posture descriptors such as the relative height of hips, spine alignment, and body weight distribution.

\textbf{Anthropometric Features:} Normalized distances between landmarks to account for different body proportions.

\textbf{Temporal Features:} Statistical measures over sliding windows to capture temporal patterns of movement.

\textbf{Relative Position Features:} Spatial relationships between body parts, critical for distinguishing exercises like pushups and planks.

The baseline model uses 6 key joint angles, while the enhanced models leverage 60 features across all categories.

\subsection{Models}
We implemented and evaluated two main classification approaches:

\textbf{Random Forest Classifier:} We developed two Random Forest models: a baseline version using only 6 key joint angles, and an enhanced version leveraging the full 60-feature set. Random Forest was chosen for its interpretability, ability to handle non-linear relationships, and feature importance analysis capabilities. The model uses 100 trees with default scikit-learn hyperparameters.

\textbf{XGBoost Classifier:} For our enhanced model, we implemented an XGBoost classifier that operates on the full 60-feature set. XGBoost provides improved performance through gradient boosting and regularization techniques. The model was tuned using grid search to optimize learning rate, max depth, and regularization parameters.

Both approaches use standard label encoding for the exercise types and include probability calibration to improve the reliability of confidence scores. The models are designed to be computationally efficient, allowing real-time inference on standard consumer hardware.

\subsection{Real-Time Inference Pipeline}
Our system implements a complete real-time inference pipeline that processes video frames through several stages:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Video Input}: Captures frames from webcam or video file
  \item \textbf{BlazePose Landmark Extraction}: Detects 33 body landmarks per frame
  \item \textbf{Landmark Processing}: Filters low-confidence landmarks (visibility < 0.5) and handles missing data
  \item \textbf{Feature Window Management}: Maintains a rolling buffer of recent frames for temporal feature extraction
  \item \textbf{Feature Extraction}: Computes static, dynamic, and temporal features from the landmark window
  \item \textbf{Model Inference}: Applies Random Forest or XGBoost classifier to predict exercise type
  \item \textbf{Repetition Counting}: Updates exercise-specific repetition counter using threshold or FSM approach
  \item \textbf{Visualization}: Renders real-time feedback with exercise type, rep count, and pose overlay
\end{itemize}

The system includes fallback mechanisms for handling poor landmark detection, maintaining prediction stability, and adapting to different users. The entire pipeline operates at over 30 FPS on standard consumer hardware, enabling true real-time feedback.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Repetition Counting}
We implemented two complementary strategies for counting exercise repetitions:

\textbf{Threshold Hysteresis:} This approach tracks a key joint angle (specific to each exercise type) as it crosses calibrated upper and lower bounds. Hysteresis prevents multiple counts when the signal fluctuates near thresholds, and a refractory period prevents rapid double-counting. For each exercise, we define appropriate thresholds (e.g., knee angle for squats: high 160°, low 80°).

\textbf{Finite-State Machine (FSM):} Our FSM approach models the exercise cycle through distinct states: STARTING → TOP → BOTTOM. State transitions occur based on joint angle thresholds specific to each exercise type. This method is particularly robust against noise and variations in exercise speed. A repetition is counted when completing a full TOP → BOTTOM → TOP cycle with appropriate dwell times at each state.

\section{Evaluation Metrics}
We evaluated our system using several metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classification Accuracy:} The overall percentage of correctly classified exercise windows.
    \item \textbf{Precision and Recall:} Per-class metrics to assess both the reliability of positive predictions and the ability to find all instances of each class.
    \item \textbf{F1-Score:} The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric especially important for classes with uneven support.
    \item \textbf{Confusion Matrix:} Detailed analysis of classification patterns, identifying common misclassifications between exercise types.
    \item \textbf{Repetition Counting Accuracy:} Mean absolute error (MAE) between system counts and ground truth, plus the percentage of counts within ±1 repetition.
\end{itemize}

We compared the enhanced feature set (60 features) against the baseline (6 features) to quantify the value of our hierarchical feature engineering approach. Additionally, we evaluated model performance in terms of computational efficiency to ensure real-time operability.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Classification Performance}
We evaluated both our baseline Random Forest classifier and enhanced models on a 20\% holdout test set. Table~\ref{tab:overall} shows the overall classification performance metrics.

The enhanced Random Forest model with 60 features achieved 91.2\% accuracy and a 0.913 F1-score, representing a substantial improvement over the baseline model with only 6 features (74.7\% accuracy, 0.751 F1-score). The XGBoost model further improved performance to 94.8\% accuracy and a 0.949 F1-score.

Table~\ref{tab:perclass} details the per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores for the Random Forest classifier with enhanced features. Squats showed the highest recognition rate (F1 = 0.953) due to their distinctive lower-body movement pattern, while jumping jacks showed high precision but lower recall, indicating some false negatives.

\subsection{Feature Importance Analysis}
The feature importance analysis from the Random Forest classifier revealed that joint angles from the lower body (knees and hips) were the most discriminative features across exercise types. Dynamic features (velocity and acceleration) were particularly important for distinguishing between exercises with similar static poses but different movement patterns.

\subsection{Repetition Counting Accuracy}
We evaluated repetition counting accuracy by comparing the system's count with manual annotations. The finite state machine approach achieved a mean absolute error of 0.18 repetitions across all exercise types, with 96\% of counts falling within ±1 repetition of the ground truth. The threshold-based approach showed slightly higher error (MAE = 0.24) but still maintained 93\% accuracy within ±1 repetition.

  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \end{adjustbox}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:rep_counting} shows the detailed repetition counting performance for each exercise type. Jumping jacks showed the highest counting accuracy with an MAE of only 0.09, likely due to their distinctive and consistent motion pattern. Lunges presented the greatest challenge with an MAE of 0.27, which can be attributed to variations in execution depth and speed among participants.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}
Despite promising results, our system has several limitations that present opportunities for future research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2D Projection Limitations:} The current system relies solely on 2D landmarks, which can lead to ambiguity when body parts overlap or when exercises have similar 2D projections but different 3D movements.
    \item \textbf{Exercise Variety:} The current implementation supports only five exercise types. Expanding to more complex exercises and variations would require additional data collection and feature engineering.
    \item \textbf{Form Assessment:} While the system can classify exercises and count repetitions, it does not yet provide detailed feedback on exercise form quality or detect potential injury risks.
    \item \textbf{Personalization:} The current model uses fixed thresholds for repetition counting rather than adapting to individual users' movement patterns.
\end{itemize}

Future work will address these limitations through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrating depth sensing or multi-view approaches where available to better resolve 3D movements
    \item Expanding the exercise library to include more activities and variations
    \item Developing form quality assessment metrics and feedback mechanisms
    \item Implementing personalization through few-shot calibration and user-specific thresholds
    \item Exploring more sophisticated temporal models such as LSTMs or temporal convolutional networks to better capture movement dynamics
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This paper presented a real-time system for exercise classification and repetition counting using Google's BlazePose model and machine learning techniques. By combining careful feature engineering with appropriate classification models and a state machine approach to repetition counting, our system achieves high accuracy while maintaining real-time performance on consumer hardware.

The hierarchical feature engineering approach demonstrated significant improvements over baseline features, particularly for exercises with distinctive lower-body movements. The system's ability to count repetitions accurately across different exercise types makes it suitable for home fitness applications, physical therapy, and athletic training.

Future work will focus on expanding the system's capabilities to include form assessment, personalization through user-specific calibration, and support for a broader range of exercises. Additionally, incorporating temporal models could further improve classification performance for exercises with similar static poses but different dynamics.

\section{System Architecture}
Our system consists of four main components that work together to provide real-time exercise classification and repetition counting. Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline} illustrates the end-to-end pipeline architecture.

\subsection{Pose Estimation Module}
This module interfaces with the camera or video input and processes frames through Google's BlazePose model to extract 33 body landmarks. The landmarks include key body joints with their x, y coordinates and confidence scores. This module handles input acquisition, frame preprocessing, and pose detection at approximately 30 FPS.

\subsection{Feature Extraction Module}
The feature extraction module processes the raw landmarks to compute biomechanically relevant features. It maintains a sliding window of recent frames to enable calculation of dynamic and temporal features. The hierarchical feature design includes static joint angles, dynamics (velocity and acceleration), posture metrics, anthropometric ratios, and temporal statistics.

\subsection{Classification Module}
This module applies machine learning models (Random Forest or XGBoost) to the extracted features to identify the exercise being performed. It includes confidence scoring, adaptive thresholding to suppress uncertain predictions, and temporal smoothing to prevent rapid classification flips.

\subsection{Repetition Counting Module}
The repetition counting module tracks exercise-specific joint angles through different states to identify and count complete repetitions. It implements both threshold-based and finite state machine approaches, with parameters adapted to each exercise type. The module includes mechanisms to prevent double-counting and handle partial or incomplete repetitions.

\subsection{Design Principles}
We prioritized: (i) interpretability (hand-crafted, labeled feature groups); (ii) latency (sub-50 ms per frame on mid-range CPU); (iii) extensibility (new feature groups pluggable via metadata); (iv) resilience (graceful fallback on missing joints / low visibility). All core logic resides in modular Python scripts under `src/` and `scripts/` directories.

\section{Dataset Details}
Raw videos were preprocessed to extract per-frame BlazePose landmarks (33 joints, x and y normalized by frame size plus visibility scores). A fixed random seed controlled train/test splits derived at the video granularity to prevent temporal leakage. Class balance is moderate; the most represented class (lunges) has roughly 1.5x the support of the least (jumping\_jacks). Future balancing strategies (focal loss, class-weighted training) remain unexplored in this iteration. Missing landmarks (visibility < 0.5) zeroed coordinates but retained structural placeholders to preserve vector dimensionality.

\subsection{Data Augmentation (Deferred)}
We investigated but did not include: (i) geometric perturbation (small affine jitter), (ii) temporal warping, (iii) synthetic interpolation between adjacent windows. Pilot tests showed negligible macro F1 gain (\(<0.01\)) while adding complexity.

\section{Feature Groups}
Feature groups are versioned via a JSON metadata file (`feature_metadata.json`):
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item G1 Angles (static): primary joint angles (elbow, knee, hip, shoulder flexion proxies).
  \item G2 Dynamics: first (velocity) and second (acceleration) temporal derivatives aggregated (mean/std/min/max).
  \item G3 Anthropometrics: ratios capturing proportion (shoulder width / torso length, limb length symmetries).
  \item G4 Posture: vertical offsets (hip to shoulder), torso inclination, center-of-mass proxies.
  \item G5 Smoothed Mirrors: EMA versions of G1 to reduce high-frequency jitter sensitivity.
  \item G6 Symmetry Indicators: left/right angle difference magnitudes, enabling detection of unilateral deviations.
\end{itemize}
An ablation-ready structure allows toggling any group to quantify incremental contribution (see Section~\ref{sec:ablation}).

\section{Implementation Details}
\subsection{Software Architecture}
The system is implemented in Python with a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FeatureExtractor class:} Handles landmark processing and feature computation
    \item \textbf{RepCounter class:} Implements repetition counting logic with exercise-specific parameters
    \item \textbf{ExerciseClassifier class:} Manages model loading, prediction, and visualization
\end{itemize}

A rolling buffer implemented with a fixed-length deque maintains the recent frame history for temporal feature extraction. Features are computed efficiently with vectorized operations using NumPy, resulting in $O(n_f)$ complexity per window where $n_f$ is the number of features.

\subsection{Real-time Performance}
We conducted detailed performance profiling on consumer hardware (laptop with Intel i5 CPU, no discrete GPU) with the following average per-frame processing times:

\begin{itemize}
    \item BlazePose inference: 15.3 ms
    \item Feature extraction: 2.4 ms
    \item Classification (Random Forest): 0.8 ms
    \item Classification (XGBoost): 1.5 ms
    \item Repetition counting: 0.3 ms
    \item Visualization: 1.2 ms
\end{itemize}

The total processing time of approximately 20 ms per frame enables real-time operation at over 45 FPS, providing smooth feedback even on modest hardware. The system is designed to gracefully handle frame drops or processing delays without affecting classification accuracy.

Table~\ref{tab:computation} provides a detailed breakdown of the computational performance of each system component. As expected, the BlazePose inference represents the most computationally intensive step, accounting for approximately 76\% of the processing time. Both classification approaches maintain real-time performance, with Random Forest being slightly faster than XGBoost.

\section{Repetition Counting Enhancements}
Both counters share a normalization stage converting angle trajectories to a detrended signal. The FSM requires stable identification of peaks/valleys: a minimum dwell of 2 frames at extrema enforces robustness. Threshold hysteresis auto-initializes bounds from the first full cycle (observed min/max with shrinkage factor 0.85). Separation interval (cooldown) of 0.35 s suppresses double-count artifacts.

\section{Evaluation Protocol}
We evaluate on window-level classification. Metrics: (i) Accuracy, (ii) Macro Precision/Recall/F1 (class balance robustness), (iii) Weighted F1 (support-weighted), (iv) Confusion matrices (both raw and normalized by true class). For per-class error inspection we rank top confusion pairs by misclassification count (Figure~\ref{fig:top_confusions}). Confidence calibration (ECE / reliability diagrams) is earmarked for future work.

\section{Ablation Study}\label{sec:ablation}
Planned: remove one feature group (G1--G6) at a time measuring macro F1 drop relative to full model. Preliminary: adding dynamics (G2) + posture (G4) accounts for majority of +0.172 macro F1. Detailed ablation table will be inserted here.

\section{Threats to Validity}
Internal: risk of subtle leakage if any video-derived statistic influenced both splits (mitigated by strict video-level partition). Construct: 2D-only landmarks underrepresent depth cues for overhead presses. External: limited demographic diversity; performance may vary with different camera heights or occlusion-heavy environments.

\section{Ethical and Practical Considerations}
System is advisory; not a medical device. Misclassification risk is mitigated by exposing confidence and allowing `unknown` gating. No personally identifiable video is stored in distribution; only derived landmark coordinates and aggregate metrics.
